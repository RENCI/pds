  description: "The PDS is the main interface to the PDS application for providing clinical decision support for end users. The PDS is a highly fault-tolerant system, meaning that it will attempt to correct errors in order to keep running and avoid catastrophic failure. This means that these endpoints will attempt to return some kind of meaningful data along with 4xx (Client Error) and 5xx (Server Error) status codes. The onus is on the client to check and determine how to render the data returned along with these codes."

      summary: "Return patient variables required by a guidance plugin"
      description: "Given a guidance plugin id (piid), mapper, FHIR plugin and patient id (ptid), return all the relevant mapped patient variable values. If no mapper or FHIR server are specified, patient variable values are returned using the system default mapper and FHIR server. If no default is set, 5xx message will warn that defaults were selected arbitrarily and the client should react appropriately. If no timestamp is provided, values will be computed relevant to the current time. Values will be returned with the patient variable 'id'; to validate that value, call the '/config/{<piid>}' endpoint and find 'id' on the list of patient variables in order to get the set of legal values for that patient variable 'id'. The same call will also return why the variable is needed by the plugin. Patient variable values are also returned by the '/guidance' endpoint."
