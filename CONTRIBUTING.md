# Contributing to _PDS_

Welcome! Happy to see you willing to make the project better. Have you read the entire
[user documentation](https://PDS.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) yet?

## Bird's eye view

In terms of inspiration, _PDS_ is about enabling researchers to creaete analytical models that can be validated 
and deployed, as-is, into clinical workflows.

Bug reports and fixes are always welcome! Please follow the
[issue template on GitHub](https://github.com/RENCI/PDS/issues/new) for best results.

Before you suggest a new feature or bugfix to core plugins, consider if it would be better 
to extend the platform with a new module written to the PDS API specs. If you do create a new module, 
let us know by adding it to the CHANGES file, and your name/contribution to the AUTHORS.

## Technicalities

Be sure to read the Developer's Guide before setting off to write any code.

## Hygiene

If you're fixing a bug, add a test. Run it first to confirm it fails, then fix the bug,
run it again to confirm it's really fixed.

If adding a new feature, add a test. In fact, always add a test. But wait, before adding
any large feature, first open an issue for us to discuss the idea first.

## Finally

Thanks again for your interest in improving the project! All contributions are welcome and encouraged.
